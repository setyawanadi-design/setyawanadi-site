Minimalism is often misunderstood as a lack of features or a cold, sterile aesthetic. But true minimalism is about clarity. It’s about stripping away everything that doesn't serve the core function or message, leaving only what is absolutely necessary.

In web design, this translates to faster load times, intuitive navigation, and content that takes center stage.

When we design without clutter, we show respect for the user's attention.
