description: I finally took the time to completely overhaul my workspace. Since I spend roughly 10 hours a day sitting here writing code, designing, and reading, it felt necessary to invest in ergonomics and minimalism.

### The Gear

The core of the setup is built around keeping wires completely invisible. The monitor is mounted on a heavy-duty arm bolted straight through the desk to avoid the clunky standard base.

*   **Display:** 32" 4K Monitor (Matte finish)
*   **Audio:** Studio reference monitors mounted on ear-level isolation pads.
*   **Input:** Split ortholinear mechanical keyboard with silent tactile switches.
*   **Lighting:** Bias lighting behind the monitor to reduce eye strain during late-night coding sessions.

### The Ergo Life

Transitioning to a split keyboard was brutal for the first two weeks. My words-per-minute tanked from 110 to roughly 40. But after forcing myself to power through the muscle memory rewrite, the shoulder pain I used to experience after long sessions has almost entirely vanished.

It's incredible how much a clean, ordered physical environment reflects on your digital output. When my desk is cluttered, my code usually looks messy too. When I sit down at this station now, it feels like sitting in a cockpit. Everything has a purpose.
