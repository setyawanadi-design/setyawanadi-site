The world of specialty coffee is vast and often intimidating, but mastering a few core brewing methods at home is easier than you think. 

### The V60 Pour Over
The V60 is all about clarity and bringing out the delicate, fruity notes of lighter roasts. 
- Use a medium-fine grind.
- Aim for a 1:16 coffee-to-water ratio.
- Keep water temperature between 90-95°C.

### The Aeropress
The Aeropress is the undisputed king of versatility. You can brew a strong, espresso-like concentrate or a smooth, clean cup depending on your technique (standard vs inverted).

Experimentation is the key. There are no strict rules, only variables to adjust until you find the perfect cup for your palate.
