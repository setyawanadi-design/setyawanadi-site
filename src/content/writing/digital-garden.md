A digital garden is a different approach to publishing. Unlike a blog, which presents chronologically ordered, finalized articles, a garden is organized topologically. It contains ideas at varying levels of refinement.

### The Seedling Stage

Some notes are seedlings, just briefly planted ideas. When I read a book or stumble upon a new piece of technology, I usually don't have a fully formed opinion yet. A seedling is just a raw note, maybe a quote, or a link to a reference.

The beauty of a digital garden is that there is no pressure to "publish." A seedling can sit on the site, visible to the public, without needing to be perfect. 

### Growing into Trees

Other ideas are robust and fully formed essays that have grown over time through iterative cultivation. 

As I revisit a seedling, I might add a new paragraph, link it to another idea, or refine the argument. Over months or years, that note might grow into a comprehensive essay.

By removing the pressure of the "publish" date, writers can freely explore thoughts in public. This site is built on Astro and Tailwind specifically to minimize the friction between thinking and publishing. I don't want to worry about CMS databases or complex backend infrastructure. I just want to write Markdown files and push to Git.

### Why Markdown?

Markdown is portable. It's future-proof. If Astro disappears tomorrow, my writing is still just plain text files that can be parsed by any program.

1. It's fast to write.
2. It's easy to read in raw form.
3. It maps perfectly to HTML output.

This topological, iterative approach to thinking online has fundamentally changed how I interact with information on the web.
